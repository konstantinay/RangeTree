# RangeTree
University project for elective course Multidimensional Data Structures. 

Python implementation of multidimensional _Range Tree_ and 
experimental evaluation with artificial and real data sets in the basic operations: 
Build, Insert, Delete, Update, Searching (kNN) Queries.

**range_tree.py** contains all necessary functions for the implementation of the tree and the operations mentioned above.

**menu.py** is a basic user interface to choose between real and/or simulated data and perform the given actions, alongside the _knn implementation_.

**data.csv** is the real dataset consisting of hospital information such as names, latitude, logitude etc.

**hospitals_rt.py** creates a table with the hospital data.
